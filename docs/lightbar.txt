##      Gather Materials
#% PCB
#$ abv
Gather together everything you need to build the lightbar module. Go over the Bill Of Materials to make sure everything in your kit was included.

Make sure you have a soldering iron, solder, and flush cutters. Having a vice or a set of 3rd hands are helpful to hold the PCB.


##      Solder Resistors
#% R[1-8]
#$ abv
All of the resistors on the board are 1k ohms. They have the color code brown-black-red-gold. 

Bend the leads to make a "staple" shape, then push them through the holes. It does not matter which way they go in, resistors aren't polarized.

Because the holes are tight, you may need to pull the leads through with pliers. Be careful not to pull <em>too</em> hard and break the reistor!

Then, flip the board over and solder each resistor in. Make sure to clip the leads afterwards.


##      Solder Shift Register
#% IC1
#$ abv
Locate the shift register chip. First, you have to bend the leads in slighty. Lay it flat against the table and press gently to straighten the leads.

Afterwards, it should fit nicely into the holes on the board. Make sure you line up the notch on the top of chip with the cresent on the board.

Then, solder the chip into the board. There are 16 pins to solder. Make sure you don't have any shorts!


##      Solder Headers
#% JP1,JP2
#$ abv
Now, to solder in the headers that allow you to chain the boards together. 

Take the female pins, the ones that are the black shrouds, and insert them into JP2. Then, flip the board over to solder them in.

Then, do the same for the male pins. These have the gold part sticking out on both ends. Place the angled part into the holes marked JP1, and then solder them in.


##      Solder LEDs
#% LED[1-8]
#$ abv
Now, the last soldering: the LEDs themselves. 

Locate the positive end of the LED. This side is placed into the hole marked with a '+'. The negative side should go in the hole to the right.

Then, before soldering, bend the LED over the side of the board flat. The LED can be soldered to the top pads on the board, then clipped.


##      Testing
#$ abv
Plug the newly-minted lightbar into the turing machine. If assembled correctly, the LEDs will light up one-by-one in order.
