%pede



All of the kit materials for a family of insects.

Our kits materials are currently divided into two sections:

kits/annelid/   - contains all analog kits
 - Ampliflier/    - class-D amplifier
 - siggen/        - function generator

kits/diplopoda/ - contains all digital kits
 - lightbar/      - strip of 8 LEDs & shift reg for use with turing machine
 - microPOV/      - microscopic Persistance Of Vision toy reward
 - oloduino/      - modular arduino clone
 - turing_base/   - base for the turing machine: arduino shield or standalone

The most interesting files are the .brd & .sch files (boards & schematics,
respectively.) The files are in EagleCAD format, which is freely available for
noncommercial use:

Most of the other files are gerbers, which are sent off to the PCB house to 
manufacture our PCBs. We use the python script gerbmerge to panel our boards for
prototyping. Our gerbmerge.conf file can be used as an example, but may not work
on your system without modification. This program is freely available online:

The directory kits/merge/ shows one of our panels.

In addition to useful files, there are a few backup files accidentally included 
in the repository. Although we try to remove them, we occassionally add them 
back in inadvertently. You can generally ignore files beginning with a period, 
ending with a ~, or having a # in their extension.

Additionally, nothing useful is currently in the code/ directory. The project in
there is part of a special project that is still under development, yet has 
little to do with %pede.


Thanks again for your early support! If you have any questions, comments, or 
nearly-insane rants, feel free to contact us!


(We're keeping ourselves quiet & hidden by calling ourselves %pede for now)
