This code is for the AVR on the oloduino that handles USB to serial & USB ICSP.

It is based on the v-usb library which provides USB 1.1 support from software,
which enables us to pack both of these capabilities into a single chip.

As of now, the code is written for a attiny861. It also very incomplete. ;-)

This codebase should be updated in the next few weeks as we are able to
prototype PCBs & officially test the code.
